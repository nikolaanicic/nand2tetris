# Nand2Tetris

Nand2Tetris is a project from the nand2tetris course. nand2tetris course takes you on a journey in which you implement a computer from the first principles, you are expected to build all of the hardware and all of the software from scratch. The first part of the course is concerned with implementing all of the hardware `CPU, RAM...` and the second part focuses on implementing the software `OS, Assember for the JACK language ...`.

# Project 1

**Project 1** concerns with implementing the elementary logic gates `and, or, xor...` as well as some more complex logic gates as the `multiplexor` and the `demultiplexor`.

# Project 2

**Project 2** is concerned with implementing the elementary pieces of an `ALU` and the `ALU` itself. To complete this project you have to implement the following chips: `half adder`, `full adder`, `incrementer`, `16 bit adder`.

# Project 3

**Project 3** is concerned with implementing the `RAM`, `Register` and `Counter`. All of the volatile memory components are based on a `D Flip-Flop`.

# Project 4

**Project 4** is concerned with implementing two programs in the `Hack` assembly language. First program is a simple multiplication and the other filling the screen with either black or white color.

# Project 5

**Project 5** is concerned with implementing the `CPU`, `Memory` and then connecting those parts together with `ROM` into the Hack computer.
